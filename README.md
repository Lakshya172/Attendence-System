Attendance System by Face Recognition and QR Code

Project Description

The Attendance System by Face Recognition and QR Code is an E-Attendance System designed to reduce the time and effort required by teachers to take attendance manually. The system automates attendance marking using face recognition and QR code scanning, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to digitize the traditional attendance system by implementing a smart and automated solution. Instead of calling names or manually marking registers, students can show their faces to the camera or scan their QR codes, and the system will automatically record their attendance, along with the timestamp. This eliminates manual errors, saves time, and provides real-time attendance records for teachers.

How It Works
 1. Face Recognition Method:
 • Each student’s facial data is collected once and stored in the system.
 • When a student enters the classroom, they simply look at the camera.
 • The system matches their face with the stored data and marks their attendance in the database.
 • At the end of the class, the teacher receives an automated attendance report.
 2. QR Code Method:
 • Each student is assigned a unique QR code.
 • The student scans their QR code using the camera.
 • The system verifies the student and marks their attendance in the database.

Features

✅ Automated Attendance: No manual marking required; the system records attendance instantly.
✅ Time Tracking: Attendance is recorded with timestamps for accurate monitoring.
✅ Database Integration: All records are stored in a structured database for future reference.
✅ Multi-Technology Support: The system supports both Face Recognition and QR Code Scanning for flexibility.
✅ Teacher Reports: At the end of the class, the teacher receives a report of all present students.

Technologies Used
 • Programming Language: Python
 • Libraries: OpenCV, face_recognition, NumPy, Pandas, PyQRCode
 • Database: SQLite (for storing student data and attendance records)
 • Algorithm: Face encoding using dlib (HOG + CNN models)
 • Web Technologies (Optional for Future Enhancements): HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for a web-based interface)

Conclusion

This system replaces manual attendance methods with an automated and efficient solution. It saves time, reduces errors, and provides real-time attendance records for teachers. The use of face recognition and QR code scanning ensures flexibility and accuracy in different classroom environments.

This project can be expanded further by integrating it with cloud databases, mobile applications, or a web-based dashboard for better usability.
